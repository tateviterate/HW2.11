		A Prayer. By Antoine de Saint­Exupery. Lord, I ask not about miracles, and not the mirages, and the strength of each day.
            Teach me the art of small steps. Make me an observant and resourceful, that the diversity of everyday life in
            time to stop on discoveries and experiences that made me excited. Teach me how to properly dispose of time in
            my life. Give me a subtle flair to distinguish primary from the secondary. I ask about the power of restraint
            and measures that I have on life fluttered and slid, and intelligently planned throughout the day, could see
            the tops and gave, and at least sometimes would find time to enjoy art. Help me to understand that dreams can
            not be a help. No dreams of the past or dreams of the future. Help me to be here and now and accept that moment
            as the most important. Protect me from a naive belief that everything in life should be smooth. Give me a clear
            consciousness that the complexity of defeat, the fall and failure are just a natural part of life, through which
            we grow and scream. Remind me that the heart is often argues with reason. Send me the right time for someone
            who has the courage to tell me the truth, but tell her loving! I know that many problems can be solved if we
            do nothing, so teach me patience. You know how much we need the friendship. Let me be worthy of the most beautiful
            and tender gift of Yours. Give me a rich imagination to the right time, at the right time, right place, silent
            or speaking, give someone the necessary heat. Do me as a man who knows how to reach those who really down. Protect
            me from fear to miss something in life. Let me not what I myself wish, but what I really need. Teach me the sad
            art of small steps. Antoine de Saint‐Exupery.
